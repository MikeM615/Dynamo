# Dynamo

I am pretty new to Revit, Dynamo and Python, so if what you see makes no sense and there are duplicated or unneccesarry steps, this is more likely due to ignorance than a good reason.

These have been tested and are working in Revit 2019, except Add Sheet Number to Placed Views, this is tested and working in 2019-2022

A lot of the code contained in these has been taken from others work and examples to turn into scripts that work with my needs, if you have any issues with them or any questions on functionality, feel free to reach out.
